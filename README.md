# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification Project applies Machine Learning using Python to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using sepal and petal measurements.  Algorithms implemented: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVC, Random Forest. Among these, KNN achieved the best performance with 96.67% CV accuracy and 93.33% test accuracy.
